# MQTT-based-iot-server
In this project, I've used two ESP8266 modules, One with DHT11 sensor and a 4 channel relay, and another with Soil moisture Sensor.
Inorder to configure the Raspberry Pi as a local server, I've installed Mosquitto MQTT broker.
The Sensor values can be viewed in a Android application.
